/*Our error middleware "error.js" catches any error in the http request process and we use winston to log the error and we return a friendly msg to the client but other errors that happens outside express/http request process, this middleware cannot handle it so that is why in "app.js" we need to call "winston.handleExceptions" to get any error/exception and log them to a file. So winston will also terminate the process.*/
