/*This section is about handling errors that can arise in real world scenario when our app is live. The backend might be done for update or maintenance, the network might go off and when this happens, clients request will keep hanging and in 30seconds later we get error in the terminal. These scenarios should be prepared for and handled properly on the server so we can always see errors arising from our app and how to fix them.*/
