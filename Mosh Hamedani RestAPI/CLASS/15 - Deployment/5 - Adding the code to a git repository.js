/*In order to deploy our app to heroku, we first need to add our app to a git repository.
 * 1) Open a command window and run 'git --version' to be sure you have installed git properly
 * 2) Run 'cd vidly-api-node'
 * 3) we start by deploying our backend first, ensure it works and then we deploy our front end
 * 4) Open the vidly-api-node folder in editor
 * 5) Add a file '.gitignore' We use this file to tell git what files and folder to be ignored.
 * Add this files: -
 * .DS_Store
node_modules/
logfile.log
* The slash at the end of the file represents a folder
* 6) save the changes
* 7) Back to the command prompt, run 'git init' > Next run 'git add . ' > Run 'git commit -m "Initial commit" (m is to specify a message)
