/*To write tests, we need a test framework. This gives us a library that includes a lot of utility functions and we use this functions to write test, it also gives us a "test runner" which is basically a program we run from the command line and this test runner execute our tests and gives us a report of how many tests passed or fail. MOST POPULAR FRAMEWORKS FOR TEST ARE:
JASMINE : Complete framework that doesnt need any plugin and its the oldest.
MOCHA : Most popular framework on npm but u need to use it with plugins like "chai" or "sinon"
JEST : A newer framework which facebook uses for testing react applications. It  is a wrapper around jasmine so if you know jasmine, you know jest.

WE WILL BE USING JEST.

The framework you use doesnt really matter, the focus is on the fundamentals of writing good unit tests and not on the tools.
