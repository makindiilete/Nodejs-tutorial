/*Now that we know the 3 tests available, what kind of test should you write in your application?
The simple answer is all of them and this is what we call test pyramid:-
You should write Unit tests since they are quick to execute
Then write integration test since they test with external dependencies and gives you few features of E2E test then you write few E2E tests to only test the key function of your application.

This is just a guideline and not a fast rule you need to follow in every application, it all depends on your project how much of each tests you write.
Unit test are ideal for testing your logic. while integration deals with test with database.*/
