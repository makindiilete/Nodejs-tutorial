//PACKAGE.JSON
/*Create a new folder 'npm-demo' which we use to follow up this course*/
/*Before you can add any package to your application, you first need to create a 'package.json' file. A package.json file is a json file that includes some basic info about your app or project such as : Name, version, Authors, Address of git repository, dependencies etc.
 *
 * To create a package.json file, run "npm init" and this will ask you series of questions for creating this file...
 *
 * So for best practise, whenever you start a node project, run "npm init" to create a "package.json"*/

//FASTER WAY TO CREATE THE PACKAGE.JSON FILE : - With this, all the questions will be skipped. To do this, run "npm init --yes"
