/*You can view the full list of all installed dependencies and their versions by running the code "npm list"...These will give you a tree of all your dependencies and their dependencies with their version.
 *
 * As you can see that this list gets polluted somehow with all the nested dependencies, if you want to avoid this and only list the major dependencies, run the code : "npm list --depth=0"*/
