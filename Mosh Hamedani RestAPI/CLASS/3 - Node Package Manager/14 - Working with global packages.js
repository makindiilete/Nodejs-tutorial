/*All the packages we have installed so far are particular to this node project in this folder but we have packages on the node registry that are not particular to an application. This are often cmd tools that can be accessed everywhere.
 *
 * One example of this is the "npm" which can be run anywhere not depending on a specific project. Another example is "ng" which is for creating angular project*/

//INSTALLING A GLOBAL PACKAGE
/*npm i -g packageName....
 *
 * All the commands we have learnt so far also works for global packages so you can find out outdated global packages using "npm -g outdated"*/

//UNINSTALL GLOBAL PACKAGE
/*npm un -g packageName*/
