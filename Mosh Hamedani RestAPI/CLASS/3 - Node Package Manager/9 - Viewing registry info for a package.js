//You can view all the meta data of your npm packages e.g. Dependencies, keywords etc by searching the package name on "https://www.npmjs.com

/*A faster way to do this is to run this code in the cmd "npm view mongoose"
 * This will search the internet for all the meta data of the package and list it out in the cmd*/

/*This list is also a complex one and hard to read. You can view a specific property of the package e.g. to view only the dependencies, you run "npm view mongoose dependencies" : - This will list out only the dependencies of mongoose. Another useful property of mongoose is "versions", this will list out all the previously released mongoose. "npm view mongoose versions" : - This property is useful in-case you want to upgrade to a newer version or downgrade to an earlier version*/
