/*We will finish converting our user routes to use authentication. There are a couple of user routes that are still not authenticated.

1-  We start by first deleting the route that get user by id because it is no longer needed as we do not want user to be able to fetch profile of other users by their id instead once they are logged in, they can fetch their personal profile with url/users/me
2-  We modify our UPDATE & DELETE route from "/users/:id" to "/users/me"
3-  We delete the user variables we are using to find the user by their id, because now we no longer need to find them by their id, our auth.js middleware already provides us with all the user details via "req.user" as long as they are logged in and their tokens via "req.token"
4-  We change all occurrences of "user" to "req.user". */
