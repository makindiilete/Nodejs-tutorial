/*We will learn how to work with global modules. So far all the packages we have worked with are local dependencies, they exist inside the package.json and we use the "require()" keyword to load them but for global modules doesnt need loading but we run them with a new command from the terminal.
*
* We will be installing a global package "nodemon" which enables us to auto re-run our app
*
* npm i -g nodemon@1.18.5
*
* To use this, we run "nodemon filename"*/
