/*Call Stack : - The job is to track the execution of our program and it does that by keeping track of all the functions that are currently running. We have seen a call stack before when we debug for error msgs. We get the actual error msg and a call stack contains a long list of all the functions that are currently running to get to that point in the program.

In a call stack, you can add something to the top of the list and you can remove the top item first. You cannot remove something from the middle without first removing the one on top and you cannot add to the bottom of the list if there are already things inside. In the call stack, functions are dropped.
