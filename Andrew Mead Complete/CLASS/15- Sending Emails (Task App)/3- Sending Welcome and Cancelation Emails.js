/*We will integrate send grid into our task manager app so when a user creates an account, they get a welcome email and you could use that to start a conversation on what they hope to get out of your products and if they cancel their account, we follow up by sending them one last email maybe asking why they choose to cancel and what we could have done to have kept them as a customer.
 *
 * To implement this, the "account.js" file will stay in place. The only difference is that we will setup functions that get called elsewhere in the application and that is how emails will get sent. For example, in the user.js, we have the user router, the first route runs when a user signup, what we will do is setup a function in account.js that actually sends an email to that new user. The text of the emaill will include their name, and the two values will be the email address they registered with.*/
