/*We will start this section by figuring out how we can add support for file uploads to the express app. For now we will not worry about users bin authenticated or the file bin of the correct type such as image. We will start by kicking off with the basics and later refine the code to fix our specific needs which is to allow a user to upload a profile pic for their account.

//HOW TO ADD SUPPORT FOR FILE UPLOAD IN EXPRESS
Express by default does not support file uploads but there is an npm library that is released and maintained by the same team behind express and this allows us to add file upload to express with just few lines of code and we will start there. THIS IS CALLED MULTER
1-  Install npm multer
So far we have been working with json to send and retrieve data in express but multer will allow us to send data using form data from which we can upload files.
*/

//FILE UPLOAD TO EXPRESS
const multer = require("multer");
//configuring multer to tell it d type of file we want to accept. This configuration will change as the type of file we want to upload changes. But for now we will just accept any type of file
const upload = multer({
  //dest = destination (folder where all d uploads sud b stored)
  dest: "images"
});

//CREATING AN ENDPOINT WHERE USER CAN USE TO UPLOAD THE FILES
//we provided multer middleware (upload.single) which takes an arg which is a name for d upload
app.post("/upload", upload.single("upload"), (req, res) => {
  res.send();
});

//RUNNING THE FILE UPLOAD USING POSTMAN
/*1-  Enter the url - localhost:3000/upload -> Change the method to POST
 * 2-  Click on the "body" type and change from "raw" to "form-data"
 * 3-  KEY -> This is the string you provided to the multer middleware in your code which in our case is "upload"
 * 4- On the right hand side of the KEY input, switch from TEXT to FILE
 * 5-  Click on "Select Files", pick an image (philly.jpg)
 * 6- Click on Send

When we send this request, express will create a new directory in our project dir and give it the name we specified (images) as our destination and place the image we uploaded inside.

//OPENING THE IMAGE
Now if we check the images folder, we see a new file has been added but we cannot open it from the editor because it is a binary file without an extension. So to open the image, we need to rename it by adding .jpg to the end.

NOTE : - We will not be adding the extension manually in the future. We will have this done for us automatically.*/

/*CHALLENGE : - Setup endpoint for avatar upload
 * 1-  Add POST /users/me/avatar to user router
 * 2-  Setup multer to store uploads in an avatars directory
 * 3-  Choose name "avatar" for the key when registering the middleware
 * 4-  Send back a 200 response from route handler
 * 5-  Test your work. Create new Task App request and upload image*/
