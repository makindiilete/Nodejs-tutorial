/*We will see how we can add other assets (css, js, img etc.) and using them in our html file
1-  In the public folder, create two new folders :- "css & js"
2-  Inside the css, create a new file "styles.css"
3-  Inside the js folder, create a new file "app.js"
4-  Now we load this files inside the html pages
Each of this files takes different content

//styles.css
h1 {
  color: grey;
}

 //app.js
 console.log("Client side javascript file is loaded!");

Now if we reload the app and check the pages, the css and js should work
